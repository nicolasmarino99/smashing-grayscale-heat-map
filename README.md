# Smashing frontpage heat map

This project was developed by Nico and Oscar (the dream team) using basic HTML tags and SASS/CSS styling.
The objective of it is to try to reflect a [heat map](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/heatmap/)
of the site [smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) front page, using grayscales to reflect
which sections are the most appealing to the eye (darkest) and which sections are not (lighter).
